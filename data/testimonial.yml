The rockstars at InterviewVector have helped us immensely in solving this problem by taking the 1st round of technical interviews and providing us the shortlisted candidates with detailed reports. The InterviewVector panel is among the best in the industry and highly effective in identifying the right technical talent. Also, the team which manages and schedules the interviews is excellent at their job. We would like to thank them for their interview services across different technologies and experience levels, making the hiring process very efficient for us."
